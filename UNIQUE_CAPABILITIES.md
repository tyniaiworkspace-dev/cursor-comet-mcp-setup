# 🌟 Perplexity MCP: Unique Capabilities Beyond Cursor's Built-in AI

## What Makes Perplexity MCP Special?

Cursor's built-in AI is powerful, but it has limitations:
- ❌ Knowledge cutoff date (no real-time information)
- ❌ Can't access the web or external APIs
- ❌ Can't extract content from URLs
- ❌ Can't check current API pricing or features
- ❌ Doesn't know about very recent updates or news

**Perplexity MCP solves all of these!** 🚀

## 🔥 Real-World Capabilities Cursor Can't Do

### 1. **Real-Time Information & Current Events** 🌐

**Example Test:**
```
"What are today's top tech news stories?"
```

**Result from Perplexity MCP (Feb 9, 2026):**
- ✅ Apple gearing up major "Apple Intelligence" beta in iOS 26.4
- ✅ Big Tech exploring orbital data centers for AI workloads
- ✅ AMD pushes silicon photonics to transform AI infrastructure

**Cursor's Built-in AI:**
- ❌ "I don't have access to current news"
- ❌ Knowledge cutoff means no 2026 information

---

### 2. **Live Market Data & Prices** 💰

**Example Test:**
```
"What's the current Bitcoin price?"
```

**Result from Perplexity MCP:**
- ✅ Current BTC Price: ~$70,460 USD (real-time data from CoinMarketCap)
- ✅ Updated: Today, February 9, 2026

**Cursor's Built-in AI:**
- ❌ Can only provide historical information
- ❌ No access to live price feeds

---

### 3. **Up-to-Date API Documentation** 📚

**Example Test:**
```
"What are the latest React 19 features?"
```

**Result from Perplexity MCP:**
- ✅ New hooks: `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `use`
- ✅ Form Actions with automatic pending states
- ✅ Server Components and Server Actions stabilized
- ✅ Direct citations from react.dev documentation

**Cursor's Built-in AI:**
- ❌ May have outdated information
- ❌ Can't verify against current documentation

---

### 4. **API Discovery with Current Pricing** 💼

**Example Test:**
```
"Find free stock market APIs for a small project"
```

**Result from Perplexity MCP:**

| API | Free Tier | Coverage | Best For |
|-----|-----------|----------|----------|
| Alpha Vantage | 25 calls/day | Global stocks, FX, crypto | Dashboards, learning |
| Twelve Data | Limited free | 50+ exchanges | Multi-exchange charts |
| StockData.org | 100 calls/day | US intraday + news | Small US apps |
| Polygon.io | 5 calls/min | Institutional data | Research |
| Alpaca | 200 calls/min | Real-time WS | Heavier intraday |

**All with direct links to documentation!**

**Cursor's Built-in AI:**
- ❌ Can suggest APIs but can't verify current pricing
- ❌ May recommend deprecated or changed services

---

### 5. **Extract & Analyze Web Content** 🔍

**Example Test:**
```
"Extract the main content from the React 19 blog post"
```

**Result from Perplexity MCP:**
- ✅ Full article text extracted
- ✅ Clean, readable format
- ✅ Works with dynamic JavaScript sites
- ✅ Special GitHub repository support

**Cursor's Built-in AI:**
- ❌ Cannot browse or fetch web pages
- ❌ Cannot access URL content

---

### 6. **Check for Deprecated Code Patterns** ⚠️

**Example Test:**
```
"Is componentWillMount deprecated in React 19?"
```

**Result from Perplexity MCP:**
- ✅ Yes, deprecated since React 16.3
- ✅ Marked as `UNSAFE_componentWillMount`
- ✅ Replacement: Use `componentDidMount` or `useEffect`
- ✅ Current best practice: Use function components
- ✅ Citations from Stack Overflow, React docs, etc.

**Cursor's Built-in AI:**
- ❌ May have outdated deprecation information
- ❌ Can't verify against current best practices
