## 🎯 How It Works

### Before (Without Skill):
```
User: "I need to use a payment API"
Agent: "Here are some payment APIs..." (uses outdated knowledge)
```

### After (With Skill):
```
User: "I need to use a payment API"
Agent: Uses perplexity-research skill:
  1. Identifies this needs current API info
  2. Chooses `find_apis` tool automatically
  3. Structures query: "Find payment APIs with free tier and good docs"
  4. Gets current options with pricing
  5. May follow up with `get_documentation` for chosen API
```

## 📋 Key Features

### Intelligent Decision Making
The skill includes a decision tree:
```
Need real-time info? → Use Perplexity
What type?
├─ Quick fact → search
├─ Technical docs → get_documentation
├─ Find service → find_apis
├─ Check deprecation → check_deprecated_code
├─ Web content → extract_url_content
└─ Complex research → chat_perplexity
```

### Pre-Built Workflows

**Technology Evaluation**:
1. Search for latest version/features
2. Get documentation for specific features
3. Find alternatives
4. Check if patterns are current

**API Integration**:
1. Find APIs matching requirements
2. Get documentation for chosen API
3. Check integration patterns aren't deprecated

**Code Modernization**:
1. Check code deprecation
2. Get documentation for replacement
3. Search for best practices

**Content Research**:
1. Search for articles
2. Extract URL content
3. Analyze with chat

### 10 Detailed Examples
The `examples.md` file includes complete workflows for:
- Framework evaluation
- Debugging deprecation warnings
- Payment integration
- Learning new tech
- Content research
- API discovery
- Security audits
- Library upgrades
- Finding alternatives
- Staying current

---

## ✨ Automatic Activation

The skill is **automatically available** - Cursor will use it when:
- You ask research questions
- You mention needing current information
- You're evaluating technologies
- You're looking for APIs or documentation
- You're checking deprecations

**No special commands needed!** The AI automatically applies the skill.

---

## 🧪 Test It Out

Try these to see the skill in action:

### Test 1: API Discovery
```
"I need a weather API for my project"
```
The agent should automatically use `find_apis` with optimized query.

### Test 2: Documentation
```
"Show me how to use FastAPI WebSockets"
```
The agent should use `get_documentation` with specific context.

### Test 3: Deprecation Check
```
"Is componentWillMount still okay to use in React?"
```
The agent should use `check_deprecated_code` automatically.

### Test 4: Current Info
```
"What's the latest version of TypeScript?"
```
The agent should recognize this needs real-time info and use `search`.
