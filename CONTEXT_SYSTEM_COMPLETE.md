## 💡 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Daily Work

```
9:00 AM - Start work
You: "What should I work on today?"
AI: *Reads TODO.md* "Top priority: [tasks]"

Throughout day - Working...

5:00 PM - Complete feature
You: "I finished the payment integration"
AI: "Let me update the context files..."
    *Suggests specific updates*
You: "Looks good"
AI: *Updates PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, ARCHITECTURE.md*
```

### Workflow 2: Returning After Break

```
Week 1 - Working on project
*Context files stay current*

Week 2-3 - Away from project

Week 4 - Return
You: "Catch me up on this project"
AI: *Reads all 6 context files*
    "Project: E-commerce platform
     Status: Payment integration complete
     Current: Building admin dashboard
     Next: User management system
     Blocker: API rate limit needs addressing"
     
*Back to full productivity in 2 minutes!*
```

### Workflow 3: Team Collaboration

```
New team member joins
Them: "Catch me up on this project"
AI: *Reads context files*
    *Provides complete project overview*
    *Explains architecture*
    *Shows current priorities*
    
*New member productive in 15 minutes instead of days!*
```
